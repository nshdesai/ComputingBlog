### What's the problem?
----
Suppose you work at _Intel_ and you were tasked with programming a robotic arm that
solders on an Integrated Circuit (IC) onto Motherboards. One of the challenges that you
would face along the way would be to find the most efficient path (or tour) that the robot
could take to solder all the contact points of the component onto the PCB.

_This_ backstory leads us to our problem: Tour Optimization

_Problem_: Tour Optimization for Robotic Arms
_Input_: As set `S` containing `n` point on a plane (these are the contact points)
_Output_: What is the shortest cycle tour that visits each point in set `S`?

Now that we have a problem statement, we can _better_ understand the scope of the problem.
This step is **crucial** to solving any algorithmic problem (whether abstract or not).

**Note**: Stop here and take a moment to solve this problem. You don't have to write a
working solution. Just _try_ to think about _how_ you would solve this problem. (I'm not going anywhere)
### What is a possible solution?
-----
**Hint**: Try to think of the most _inefficient_ solution first. Try to improve your solution later.

 Now that you have thought of a solution. Let me tell you about one solution that comes to mind
 What if we just compute all the permutations of all th
